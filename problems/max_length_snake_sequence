Find maximum length Snake sequence
Given a grid of numbers, find maximum length Snake sequence and print it.
If multiple snake sequences exists with the maximum length, print any one of them.

A snake sequence is made up of adjacent numbers in the grid such that for each number,
the number on the right or the number below it is +1 or -1 its value. For example,
if you are at location (x, y) in the grid, you can either move right i.e. (x, y+1) if that number is ± 1 or move down
i.e. (x+1, y) if that number is ± 1.

For example,

9, 6, 5, 2
8, 7, 6, 5
7, 3, 1, 6
1, 1, 1, 7

In above grid, the longest snake sequence is: (9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 6, 7)
