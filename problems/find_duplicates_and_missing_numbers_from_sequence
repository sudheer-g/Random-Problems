Given an unsorted array of n elements which contains elements from 0 to n-1, with any of these numbers appearing any
number of times. The array will contain some duplicates in place of numbers that should have been present in the sequence.

Challenge:
Find all the missing numbers and the duplicates that took their place in the array. Find these in O(n) time and constant
space.

Example Scenario:
n = 5
Array -> { 2, 2, 4, 0, 1}

Here the result should be as follows:
Duplicate Elements -> [2]
Missing ELements -> [3]
